      "content='<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question \"How to check disk usage in Linux?\" based on the provided context. Let me go through the context step by step.\\n\\nLooking at the context, there\\'s a section about the \\'df\\' command. It says that df stands for \"disk free\" and it\\'s used to get details about the file system. The example shows using \\'df -h\\', which makes the output more readable in human-readable format, like showing sizes in MB or GB instead of bytes.\\n\\nI remember seeing other commands like \\'du\\' mentioned elsewhere, but in this context, only \\'df\\' is discussed for disk usage. So I should focus on that. The answer should mention using \\'df -h\\' to display the disk space information in a user-friendly way.\\n\\nWait, does the context explicitly say that \\'df\\' checks disk usage? Yes, it says \"df command in Linux gets the details of the file system.\" So that\\'s exactly what is needed for checking disk usage. I should explain how using \\'df -h\\' provides a clear overview of disk space.\\n\\nI think the answer should be straightforward: use the df command with the \\'-h\\' option to view disk usage in a readable format. That\\'s all based on the given context, so no need to add anything else.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo check disk usage in Linux, you can use the `df` command along with the `-h` option for a human-readable output. Here\\'s how:\\n\\n1. Open your terminal.\\n2. Type the following command:\\n   ```bash\\n   df -h\\n   ```\\n3. Press Enter to execute the command.\\n\\nThis will display information about your disk space usage in a user-friendly format, showing the file system, total size, used space, available space, and the percentage of disk used. The `-h` option stands for \"human-readable,\" making the output easier to understand by displaying sizes in units like MB or GB instead of bytes.\\n\\nFor example, the output might look like this:\\n\\n```\\nFilesystem      Size  Used Available Use% Mounted on\\n/dev/sda1        50G   20G     30G    40% /\\n```\\n\\nThis shows that the root directory (/) is using 40% of its 50GB disk space.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'deepseek-r1:14b', 'created_at': '2025-02-19T21:01:22.7321154Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 46046729300, 'load_duration': 8033144200, 'prompt_eval_count': 970, 'prompt_eval_duration': 2455000000, 'eval_count': 479, 'eval_duration': 35556000000, 'message': Message(role='assistant', content='', images=None, tool_calls=None)} id='run-27451ea8-2fc5-472b-8614-312af7b938b8-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 970, 'output_tokens': 479, 'total_tokens': 1449}\n"
